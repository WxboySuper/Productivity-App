# Testing Documentation

## Test Organization

The test suite is organized into several key areas:

- Unit tests using Python's unittest framework
- Doctests embedded in docstrings
- Integration tests
- Regression tests

## Test Conventions

### Test Case Naming

- Test methods should start with `test_`
- Test class names should end with `TestCase` or `Test`
- Test files should start with `test_`

### Test Structure

1. Each test file should focus on testing a single module/component
2. Test classes should inherit from `unittest.TestCase`
3. Use descriptive test method names that indicate what is being tested

### Assertions

- Use standard unittest assertions
- For floating point comparisons, use `assertApproxEqual` with appropriate tolerance levels
- Include meaningful assertion messages

### Test Documentation

- Include docstrings explaining test purpose
- Document test data and expected outcomes
- Use clear examples in doctests

### Test Runners

- Tests can be run using unittest or doctest runners
- Support for running single tests or test suites
- JUnit XML output supported for CI integration

### Debug Support

- Tests support post-mortem debugging
- PDB integration available for debugging test failures
- Use `debug()` method for stepping through failing tests

### Test Results

Test results include:

- Number of tests run
- Failures and errors
- Skipped tests
- Test duration metrics
- stdout/stderr capture when buffering enabled

## Best Practices

1. Keep tests isolated and independent
2. Clean up test resources properly
3. Use appropriate test fixtures
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
